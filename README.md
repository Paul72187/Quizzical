# Quizzical

Quizzical is a simple quiz app with typical general knowledge questions, structured in a multiple choice answer format, where each question has one correct answer from the four options given.

The app is built using a combination of JavaScript, html and CSS, with a JSON database containing 250 quiz questions. For each quiz game, players will be given a random selection of 10 of these 250 questions. Each correct answer is given a score of 10, with each incorrect answer failing to register a score. Therefore there is a maximum of 100 points on offer in each game, should the player manage to navigate their way through their selection of 10 questions without error! The top 5 players to have completed the quiz will have the honour of being on the "High Score" leaderboard!
